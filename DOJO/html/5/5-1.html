    <p>
        At the table in the <span class="place">kitchen</span>, there were three
        bowls of <span class="food">porridge</span>. <span class="person">Goldilocks</span>
        was hungry. She tasted the <span class="food">porridge</span> from the first bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
        "This <span class="food">porridge</span> is too hot!" she exclaimed.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, she tasted the <span class="food">porridge</span> from the second bowl.
    </p>

    <p>
        "This <span class="food">porridge</span> is too cold," she said
    </p>
    <p>
        So, she tasted the last bowl of <span class="food">porridge</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Ahhh, this <span class="food">porridge</span> is just right," she said
        happily and she ate it all up.
