    <title>Hello World, Take 1</title>

    <!--
       Because Dojo is being served from AOL's server, we have to provide a
       couple of extra configuration options in djConfig as the XDomain
       build (dojo.xd.js) gets loaded.

       Thus, we associate the "dtdg" namespace w/ a particular relative path
       on disk by specifying a baseUrl along with a collection of namespace mappings.
       If we were using a local copy of Dojo, we could simply stick the
       dtdg directory beside the dojo directory and it would have been
       found automatically.

       Specifying that dijits on the page should be parsed on page load
       is normally standard for any situation in which you have dojoType tags in the page.

    -->

    <!--
        You'll normally include the dojo.css file, followed by
        any of your own specific style sheets. Remember that if you're not using
        AOL's XDomain build, you'll want to point to your own local dojo.css file.

This is where the Dojo parser swaps in the dijit from the
dojo.require statement based on our parseOnLoad:true option.
Any styles applied to the dijit are provided by the style sheets imported.
